# Exception Handling in Python

## What is an Exception?

An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program that disrupts the normal flow of instructions. When an error occurs, Python generates an exception that can be handled, which avoids the program from crashing.

## Types of Exceptions

There are two types of exceptions in Python:

1. **Syntax Error**: These errors occur when the parser detects a syntax error. For example, if you forget to close a bracket or misspell a keyword, Python will raise a syntax error.

2. **Exceptions**: These errors occur during the execution of the program. For example, if you try to divide a number by zero, Python will raise an exception.

## Handling Exceptions

To handle exceptions in Python, you can use the `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks. The `try` block contains the code that might raise an exception, and the `except` block contains the code that handles the exception. The `finally` block contains the code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not.

```python
try:
  # code that might raise an exception
  x = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
  # code that handles the exception
  print("Cannot divide by zero!")
finally:
  # code that will be executed regardless of whether an exception is raised or not
  print("The program has ended.")
```

```sh
$ python main.py

Cannot divide by zero!
The program has ended.
```

## Raising Exceptions

You can raise exceptions in Python using the `raise` statement. This allows you to create custom exceptions and handle them in your code.

```python
x = -1

if x < 0:
  raise Exception("Number cannot be negative!")
```

```sh
$ python main.py

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 4, in <module>
    raise Exception("Number cannot be negative!")
Exception: Number cannot be negative!
```

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned about exception handling in Python. You learned about the different types of exceptions, how to handle exceptions using the `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks, and how to raise exceptions using the `raise` statement. Exception handling is an essential concept in Python programming that allows you to handle errors gracefully and prevent your program from crashing.
