# Collections in Python

## Collections

In Python, collections are containers that are used to store collections of data, for example, list, dict, set, tuple, etc. These are built-in collections. Several modules have been developed that provide additional data structures to store collections of data. One such module is the Python Collections Module.

## Python Collections Module

The Python Collections Module provides alternatives to built-in data types that are more powerful, faster, and have more features. The module implements specialized container datatypes providing alternatives to Python's general-purpose built-in containers like dict, list, set, and tuple.

### Counter

The Counter class in Python is a subclass of the dict class. It is used to count the number of elements in an iterable. The Counter class is a part of the collections module.

```python
from collections import Counter

# List of elements
elements = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'a', 'b', 'a']

# Count the number of elements
count = Counter(elements)

print(count)
```

```sh
$ python main.py
Counter({'a': 3, 'b': 2, 'c': 1})
```

### defaultdict

The defaultdict class in Python is a subclass of the dict

class. It is used to provide a default value for a key that does not exist. The defaultdict class is a part of the collections module.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

# Define a defaultdict
d = defaultdict(int)

# Add elements to the defaultdict
d['a'] = 1
d['b'] = 2

print(d['a'])
print(d['b'])
print(d['c'])
```

```sh
$ python main.py
1
2
0
```

### deque

The deque class in Python is a subclass of the list class. It is used to create a double-ended queue. The deque class is a part of the collections module.

```python

from collections import deque

# Define a deque
d = deque([1, 2, 3])

# Add elements to the deque
d.append(4)
d.appendleft(0)

print(d)
```

```sh
$ python main.py
deque([0, 1, 2, 3, 4])
```

### namedtuple

The namedtuple class in Python is a subclass of the tuple class. It is used to create a tuple with named fields. The namedtuple class is a part of the collections module.

```python
from collections import namedtuple

# Define a namedtuple
Point = namedtuple('Point', ['x', 'y'])

# Create a Point object
p = Point(1, 2)

print(p.x)
print(p.y)
```

```sh
$ python main.py
1
2
```

### OrderedDict

The OrderedDict class in Python is a subclass of the dict class. It is used to create a dictionary that remembers the order of the keys. The OrderedDict class is a part of the collections module.

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

# Define an OrderedDict
d = OrderedDict()

# Add elements to the OrderedDict
d['a'] = 1
d['b'] = 2
d['c'] = 3

print(d)
```

```sh
$ python main.py
OrderedDict([('a', 1), ('b', 2), ('c', 3)])
```

### ChainMap

The ChainMap class in Python is used to combine multiple dictionaries or mappings. The ChainMap class is a part of the collections module.

```python
from collections import ChainMap

# Define two dictionaries
dict1 = {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
dict2 = {'c': 3, 'd': 4}

# Create a ChainMap
chain = ChainMap(dict1, dict2)

print(chain)
```

```sh
$ python main.py
ChainMap({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, {'c': 3, 'd': 4})
```

## Conclusion

In this article, we discussed the Python Collections Module and its various classes like Counter, defaultdict, deque, namedtuple, OrderedDict, and ChainMap. These classes provide alternatives to Python's built-in data types and offer more features and functionality.

## Challenge Yourself

### Easy Challenge

1. Create a Counter object to count the number of characters in a string.
2. Create a defaultdict object to store the frequency of words in a list.
3. Create a deque object and perform various operations like append, appendleft, pop, popleft.

### Medium Challenge

1. Create a namedtuple to store the details of a student like name, roll number, and marks.
2. Create an OrderedDict to store the details of students in a class and display the details in the order of roll numbers.
3. Create a ChainMap to combine two dictionaries and access the values using keys.

### Hard Challenge

1. Create a program that uses all the classes from the Python Collections Module to perform various operations like counting the number of elements, storing default values, creating a double-ended queue, creating a tuple with named fields, creating a dictionary that remembers the order of keys, and combining multiple dictionaries.
