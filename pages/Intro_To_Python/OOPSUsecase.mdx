# Use of OOP in Python

## Classes and Objects

Python is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Python is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
```python
class Car: # class definition
  def __init__(self, modelYear, modelName):
    self.modelYear = modelYear
    self.modelName = modelName
```

An object is created from a class. We can create many objects from a class. An object is also called an instance of a class.

```python
myCar = Car(1969, "Mustang") # create an object of Car
print(myCar.modelYear, myCar.modelName) # output the value of the modelYear and modelName attributes
```
```sh
PC $ python main.py

1969 Mustang
```

## Encapsulation

Encapsulation in Python is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.

In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

There are 3 access modifiers in Python:
- private: The code is only accessible within the declared class.
- public: The code is accessible from all classes.
- protected: The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses.

### Private Variables

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self):
    self.__name = "John" # private variable

myObj = Person()
print(myObj.__name) # error
```
```sh
$ python main.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "main.py", line 6    , in <module>
    print(myObj.__name) # error
AttributeError: 'Person' object has no attribute '__name'
```

### Public Variables

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self):
    self.name = "John" # public variable

myObj = Person()
print(myObj.name) # John
```
```sh
$ python main.py
John
```


### Protected Variables

```python
class Person:
  def __init__(self):
    self._name = "John" # protected variable

myObj = Person()
print(myObj._name) # John
```
```sh
$ python main.py
John
```
