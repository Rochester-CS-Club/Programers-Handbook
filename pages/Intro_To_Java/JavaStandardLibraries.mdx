Java has a large number of libraries that are included with the JDK. These libraries are known as the Java Standard Libraries. They are divided into packages and classes. The Java Standard Libraries are organized into packages. Each package contains a set of related classes. The Java Standard Libraries are grouped into several packages. Some of the most important packages are:

- `java.lang` - Contains classes that are fundamental to the design of the Java programming language. The most important classes in this package are `Object`, `String`, `StringBuffer`, `System`, `Thread`, `Math`, `Integer`, `Float`, `Double`, `Boolean`, and `Character`.

- `java.util` - Contains the collections framework, legacy collection classes, event model, date and time facilities, internationalization, and miscellaneous utility classes (a string tokenizer, a random-number generator, and a bit array).

- `java.io` - Contains classes for input and output operations.

- `java.net` - Contains classes for networking.

- `java.awt` - Contains classes for creating user interfaces and for painting graphics and images.
