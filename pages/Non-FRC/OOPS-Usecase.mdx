# Use of OOP in Java

## Classes and Objects

Java is an object-oriented programming language. Everything in Java is associated with classes and objects, along with its attributes and methods. For example: in real life, a car is an object. The car has attributes, such as weight and color, and methods, such as drive and brake.

A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
```java
class Car { // class definition
  int modelYear;
  String modelName;
}
```

An object is created from a class. We can create many objects from a class. An object is also called an instance of a class.

```java
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Car myCar = new Car(); // create an object of Car
    myCar.modelYear = 1969; // set the value of the modelYear attribute to 1969
    myCar.modelName = "Mustang"; // set the value of the modelName attribute to Mustang
    System.out.println(myCar.modelYear + " " + myCar.modelName); // output the value of the modelYear and modelName attributes
  }
}
```
```sh
PC $ java Main

1969 Mustang
```

## Encapsulation


Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on the data (methods) together as a single unit.
In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. Therefore, it is also known as data hiding.

There are 3 access modifiers in Java:
- private: The code is only accessible within the declared class.
- public: The code is accessible from all classes.
- protected: The code is accessible in the same package and subclasses.

### Private Variables

```java
class Person {
  private String name; // private variable
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person myObj = new Person();
    myObj.name = "John"; // error
    System.out.println(myObj.name); // error
  }
}
```
```sh
PC $ java Main

Main.java:6: error: name has private access in Person
    myObj.name = "John"; // error
         ^
Main.java:7: error: name has private access in Person

    System.out.println(myObj.name); // error
                           ^
2 errors
```
Did you get an error? Because you cannot access a private variable from outside the class.

### Public Variables

```java
class Person {
  private String name; // private variable
  public String getName() { // getter method
    return name;
  }
  public void setName(String newName) { // setter method
    this.name = newName;
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person myObj = new Person();
    myObj.setName("John");
    System.out.println(myObj.getName());
  }
}
```
```sh
PC $ java Main

John
```

### Protected Variables

```java
class Person {
  protected String name; // protected variable
}

class Student extends Person {
  private int graduationYear;
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Student myObj = new Student();
    myObj.graduationYear = 2010;
    myObj.name = "John";
    System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.name);
    System.out.println("Graduation Year: " + myObj.graduationYear);
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Student myObj = new Student();
    myObj.graduationYear = 2010;
    myObj.name = "John";
    System.out.println("Name: " + myObj.name);
    System.out.println("Graduation Year: " + myObj.graduationYear);
  }
}

```
```sh
PC $ java Main

Name: John
Graduation Year: 2010
```


To achieve encapsulation in Java:
- Declare the variables of a class as private.
- Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.



```java
class Person {
  private String name; // private variable
  public String getName() { // getter method
    return name;
  }
  public void setName(String newName) { // setter method
    this.name = newName;
  }
}

class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person myObj = new Person();
    myObj.setName("John");
    System.out.println(myObj.getName());
  }
}
```
```sh
PC $ java Main

John
```

## Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism in which one class acquires the properties and behavior of another class. The class that inherits the properties of another class is known as a subclass (derived class), and the class whose properties are inherited is known as a superclass (base class).

```java
class Animal {
  void eat() {
    System.out.println("eating...");
  }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
  void bark() {
    System.out.println("barking...");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog d = new Dog();
    d.bark();
    d.eat();
  }
}
```
```sh
PC $ java Main

barking...
eating...
```

## Polymorphism

Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.

```java
class Animal {
  void sound() {
    System.out.println("Animal makes a sound");
  }
}
class Dog extends
Animal {
  void sound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}
class Cat extends
Animal {
  void sound() {
    System.out.println("Cat meows");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Animal myAnimal = new Animal();
    Animal myDog = new Dog();
    Animal myCat = new Cat();
    myAnimal.sound();
    myDog.sound();
    myCat.sound();
  }
}
```
```sh
PC $ java Main

Animal makes a sound
Dog barks
Cat meows
```

## Abstraction

Abstraction is a process of hiding the implementation details and showing only functionality to the user.

```java
abstract class Animal {
  abstract void sound();
}

class Dog extends
Animal {
  public void sound() {
    System.out.println("Dog barks");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Dog myDog = new Dog();
    myDog.sound();
  }
}
```
```sh
PC $ java Main

Dog barks
```
