# Basic Syntax and Usage

## Syntax

### If Statements

In Java, an `if` statement is used to test a condition. It executes a block of code if the condition is true.

```java
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}
```

### If-Else Statements

An `if-else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is true, and another block of code if the condition is false.

```java
if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is false
}
```

### If-Else-If Statements

An `if-else-if` statement is used to test multiple conditions.

```java
if (condition1) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // block of code to be executed if condition2 is true
} else {
  // block of code to be executed if none of the conditions are true
}
```

### Switch Statements

A `switch` statement is used to select one of many code blocks to be executed.

```java
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // block of code to be executed if expression is equal to value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // block of code to be executed if expression is equal to value2
    break;
  default:
    // block of code to be executed if expression is not equal to any of the values
}
```

### For Loops

A `for` loop is used to execute a block of code a specified number of times.

```java
for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // block of code to be executed
}
```

### While Loops

A `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as the condition is true.

```java
while (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed
}
```

### Do-While Loops

A `do-while` loop is used to execute a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly execute it as long as the condition is true.

```java
do {
  // block of code to be executed
} while (condition);
```

## Usage

### If Statements

```java
int x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
  System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
}
```

### If-Else Statements

```java
int x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
  System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else {
  System.out.println("x is not greater than 5");
}
```

### If-Else-If Statements

```java
int x = 10;

if (x > 5) {
  System.out.println("x is greater than 5");
} else if (x < 5) {
  System.out.println("x is less than 5");
} else {
  System.out.println("x is equal to 5");
}
```

### Switch Statements

```java
int day = 4;

switch (day) {
  case 1:
    System.out.println("Sunday");
    break;
  case 2:
    System.out.println("Monday");
    break;
  case 3:
    System.out.println("Tuesday");
    break;
  case 4:
    System.out.println("Wednesday");
    break;
  case 5:
    System.out.println("Thursday");
    break;
  case 6:
    System.out.println("Friday");
    break;
  case 7:
    System.out.println("Saturday");
    break;
  default:
    System.out.println("Invalid day");
}
```

### For Loops

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  System.out.println(i);
}
```

### While Loops

```java
int i = 0;

while (i < 5) {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
}
```

### Do-While Loops

```java
int i = 0;

do {
  System.out.println(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);
```
