# Control Flow Statements

Control flow statements are used to control the flow of execution in a program. They are used to make decisions, loop over code blocks, and define functions.

## If Statements

The `if` statement is used to execute a block of code if a condition is true.

```java
if (condition) {
    // code block
}
```

The `else` statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is false.

```java
if (condition) {
    // code block
} else {
    // code block
}
```

The `else if` statement is used to execute a block of code if the condition is false and another condition is true.

```java
if (condition) {
    // code block
} else if (condition) {
    // code block
}
```

## Switch Statements

The `switch` statement is used to execute a block of code based on the value of a variable.

```java
switch (expression) {
    case value1:
        // code block
        break;
    case value2:
        // code block
        break;
    default:
        // code block
}
```

## Loops

Loops are used to execute a block of code multiple times.

### For Loop

The `for` loop is used to execute a block of code a specified number of times.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    // code block
}
```

### While Loop

The `while` loop is used to execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

```java
while (condition) {
    // code block
}
```

### Do-While Loop

The `do-while` loop is used to execute a block of code at least once, and then repeatedly execute it as long as a condition is true.

```java
do {
    // code block
} while (condition);
```

## Break, Continue and Return Statements

The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or switch statement.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        break;
    }
}
```

The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code in a loop and continue with the next iteration.

```java
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    if (i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
}
```
The `return` statement is used to exit a function and return a value.

```java
public int add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
